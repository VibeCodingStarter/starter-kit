Next.js boilerplate with everything you need to build AI-enabled SaaS applications **quickly**.

Right after cloning this Starter Kit repo, you get a fully functional web application with authentication, user management, AI integrations, and UI components. [Admin console](https://vibecoding.ad/console) and [Cloud API](https://api.vibecoding.ad) are pre-wired for you to manage your users and projects.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VibeCodingStarter/starter-kit.git cool-project
cd cool-project

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create .env file
cp .env.example .env.local

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

One-liner for Mac/Linux:

```bash
printf "Project name (default: cool-project): " && read PROJECT_NAME && PROJECT_NAME=${PROJECT_NAME:-cool-project} && git clone https://github.com/VibeCodingStarter/starter-kit.git $PROJECT_NAME && cd $PROJECT_NAME && npm install && cp .env.example .env.local && npm run dev
```

One-liner for Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
$PROJECT_NAME = Read-Host "Project name (default: cool-project)"; if (!$PROJECT_NAME) { $PROJECT_NAME = "cool-project" }; git clone https://github.com/VibeCodingStarter/starter-kit.git $PROJECT_NAME; cd $PROJECT_NAME; npm install; Copy-Item .env.example .env.local; npm run dev
```

> **Quick setup:** Copy the one-liner above for your platform and paste it into your terminal. It will prompt for a project name (press Enter to use `cool-project` as the default), then clone the repository, install dependencies, and start the development server.
